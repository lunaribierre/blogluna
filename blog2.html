This weekend, during a short trip to Berlin with my friends, we went to a techno party. A universe that is kind of foreign to me. The first few minutes of this party completely matched the cliché I had of it. It takes place in a large, abandoned industrial building. The people were mostly dressed all in black, and the music playing was closer to a repetition of raw sounds/noises than a catchy melody (I'm very aware that this image is very superficial).
The reason I'm telling you about my evening is because it made me question the relation between techno music and its image. What I found interesting about that evening is that it was an initiation into a universe I'm unfamiliar with. I discovered an atmosphere, a musicality that I wasn't used to. I felt like I was entering a piece of Berlin history. Unfortunately, this experience was false. 
<br><br>
I wasn't in an underground club or a squat, surrounded by people actively contributing to the cultural enrichment of the Berlin techno scene. In fact, the party was an event organized by a brand to promote one of its products. The party was just an impression of an alternative party. It incorporated all the codes that the general public knows from the techno universe; its intention was to recreate what our imagination thinks of a techno party is, to just satisfy the "consumer." That's why when I arrived at the party I wasn't surprised by the whole experience; it only corroborated the stereotypes I had of a techno party.
This whole situation clearly shows that techno has moved past its status as an underground movement. iIt is interesting to see that now it is a selling point for brands and an attraction for tourists. By this evolution of cultural status, the integrity of its philosophy is reconsidered. The techno community has developed around the idea of bringing together people (without discrimination) to share an effervescent moment. Although if it is reused for a brand advantage it will be by definition excluding. The main goal is not to create a safe space for everyone but to make them desire the brand or a product. And if you are not the target you will not be welcome to the party.
