          <p class="titrebis">Typannot - Inventing a new writing system</p>
            <p class="domaine">led by the Gestual Script team</p>
            <p class="domainebis">an on going project</p>
Today, I present you Typannot to continue on the same subject as last week, the challenge of transcribing sign language in writing. Typannot as for goal to create a universal writing system of sign language. For this project, linguists and type designers are collaborating. 
With this article we will how the mouvement, the body posture and the facial expression are taking into account to be as true and transparent to the sign language.
The font studied last week, created by Tarek Alsawwa were just an illustration of the hands position to represent the alphabetic letters. That being a very low representation and enable a very limited use of the language. 
<br><br>
From the start Typannot takes in consideration the complexity of signs languages. They are conscious that signs languages are not sign retranscription of orals languages but an independent system of communication. We can observe that by their willing to detail every part involved in the sign language, not only the hands, by creating 4 fonts each for a part evolved in the signing (hands, upper limbs, face and mouvement). This allow an accurate retranscription, with it’s own syntax, body language, expression of emotions.
<br><br>
What especially intriguing in this project it’s that it is rooted to the present and the new technology, with for example the use of contextual ligatures coded with Python, the use of thousands of glyphes, and motion capture*…
We can make a connection with lack of writing system for sign language with a lack of technology able to transcribe it before now. Obviously, I know that it’s not true, or not the principal reason. But I find it refreshing the use of new technology it prove that there is a real willingness to reapply same the rules and remedy use for the writing transcription of orals languages to the signs languages. 
As you can assume, I am convinced by this project. That stand out for it comprehension of the language, it’s complexity and autonomy from oral language. All of this creates a really complete transcription. But now I asking myself about its usability, and its accessibility. If it use several new technology we are in the right to asked yourself if it doesn’t combine too much novelty to not scared the user. We can say that this could create a barrier to its use and distribution.
<br><br>
* These are complicated tools to explain, I advise you to read the Typannot web page to understand them better.
