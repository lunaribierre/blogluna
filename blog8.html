          <p class="titrebis">How can editorial design combine the comfort of reading with creating a unique moment of reading? </p>
            <p class="domaine">Frankenstein — If You Love Solitude, You Don’t Love Freedom published by Bruno </p>
            <p class="domainebis">2025</p>
I ask myself this question by looking at this book, Frankenstein — If You Love Solitude, You Don’t Love Freedom. To me there is no doubt this is a beautiful book/object, but what is its purpose? It has a beautiful and complex layout that plays with colours of the text and superposition of image and text. So when you skim over it, you can be really surprised and captivated by how it looks; personally, it was the case. I don’t ever really see books of this format and with this quantity of text having such a characteristic design. For its form alone, it's an impressive book. But isn’t all of this smoke and mirrors? 
<br><br>
First of all, the principle behind the layout is very literal; different texts are grafted to each other, just like the creature of Dr Frankenstein. Thus, it can feel a bit repetitive to show the same as what happens in the story.
<br><br>
Secondly, for a text this long, what's most important is not a strong identity in its layout but real reading comfort. Because if the text takes too much energy to read, nobody will do it. All of this made me think of the MAYA principle by Raymond Loewy; in design you need to follow this mantra: « Most advanced yet acceptable». As designers, we need to seek progress and novelty, but we have to be conscious of the user’s habits to not lose him in too much change. This book design is so far away from what a classic book looks like that it feels more like a work of art than a book made to be read.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The problem with this book is that the graphic designer didn’t know how to choose the intensity of their intention. Like, it’s not a problem to be willing to carry the reader in a particular moment and to craft by hand an immersive experience, but you need to be aware that the most important thing in a book is its content, not its layout. The purpose of editorial design is to elevate the content, not overlap it.
<br><br>
<br><br>
So now the question is where to position ourselves on a line between reading comfort and an expressive layout when you have this book to design. 
It’s obvious that even with a very classical design this book will not be read by everyone. Its text by itself is very experimental. So we can see why the designer chose to go the same way with the conception. The target for this book might be people that are interested in theatre or contemporary art or that are absolute fans of the original text, Frankenstein. But in its actual form, the content is too badly handled to be appealing to people for its message. In the end it’s a book with a really expressive design that might only be bought by graphic designers because they are impressed by its form. So this design really needs to subdue its layout design. To please a broader target and to really diffuse the purpose of the book. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
In conclusion, combining the comfort of reading and a unique reading experience is a formula graphic designers need to readjust at every project. There's no magic formula, but every book is created in a unique context, with a unique message, for a specific target. All of these elements are what guide designers in their creation and indicate what factors we can play with to create a unique layout for a unique text.
