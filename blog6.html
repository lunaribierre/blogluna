          <p class="titrebis">The power of a small photographic book</p>
            <p class="domaine">Brest par Nathalie Bihan </p>
            <p class="domainebis">2024</p>

When we think of a photobook, we imagine an illustrated book, which is imposing in its size, weight, and price. As if it was that the only form for this type of books. Yet, I find that Nathalie Bihan's book, Brest, published in 2024 by Pain Perdu, has all the qualities of a perfect photobook. A photography book's role is to diffuse photography beyond exhibition spaces, to offer the artist's work biggest freedom of movement and distribution. We can ask ourselves: what the purpose of a wider distribution? And is that archetype of the photography book the best way to fulfill this goal?
<br><br>
For me, this form of dissemination is a way to take photography out of the solemn space of the museum. To offer the public the opportunity to discover piece of art they wouldn't see otherwise because they don't feel welcome to the museum. But today, in the time of self-publishing, the photo book is also a way for photographers to present their work without having to seek the validation of cultural institutions. It’s the medium that makes photography accessible to a larger audience and gives artists the opportunity to share their work without the support of cultural institutions.
<br><br>
The book Brest falls into this category of books that use the photo book as an alternative way of distribution for a non-specialist audience. It uses the book form to express its position and challenges the archetypal form of the photo book and its institutional conventions. It does not seek to be presented as a sacred cultural monument, but as an artistic production open to everyone. This is evident in its format,200 mm x 130 mm and its 20 pages. In its price it cost 10 euros. In its format it is not a hard, cloth cover or a square back glued binding, but a soft cover and sewn binding.
<br><br>
While it is not a formal and typical photobooks, its design is far from simplistic. Through its risograph printing process, the book has a completely unique character; it is not only a printed and bound reproduction of a series of photographs. This printing technique lends the photos a phantasmagorical quality thanks to the visible trame, combined with vibrant and fluorescent colors that create a dreamlike quality. This effect is in discrepancy with the subject matter of the photos: the urban landscapes of Brest. However, it makes perfect sense within the context of the book, an ode to this city and its often-perceived, bleak landscapes, which here become extraordinary places.
